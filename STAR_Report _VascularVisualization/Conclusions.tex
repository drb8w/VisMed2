\subsection{Conclusions}

We saw now different techniques of directly and indirecly visualize vascular structures.

In regards of the indirect surface visualization techniques we saw that the choosen technology heavily depends on the further use of the data. For educational visualization sometimes more easy model-bades visualizations are preffered as they remove unnecessary or abnormal data more easily and focus on the model that actually should be shown and understood. In clinical diagnosis however every abnormal detail of a blods vessel is maybe of highly interest and so maybe model-free approaches could provide better results as they are closer to the original data. Also the further usage of the generated data may influence the selected methodology. For instance it could be advisable for fluid simulations to have quad based patches instead of triangular ones.

We have to conclude that actually the application leads to the proper selection of the choosen visualization. 
As the field is an ever growing area we are sure that the techniques presented eihter will be extended in already suggested or completely new ways along with the evolution of possibly totally new ones.
