\section{Introduction}

The cardiovascular system and its components have been vastly studied and a lot 
of visualization techniques to study the heart or the arteries of the human body 
have  been  proposed.  In  this  STAR  report,  you  need  to  conduct  a  survey  on 
important  medical  visualization  applications  that  cover  the  topic  of 
cardiovascular visualization, to propose a taxonomy of the existing applications, 
and to provide an overview of yet-unaddressed or challenging topics.  

% Intro from MedVis book
For diagnosis as well as for therapy planning it is crutial to understand the branching pattern and morphology of tree-like anatomical structures \cite{preim2013visual}.
Depending on the capturing technique we are confronted with 3D data that could have very high spacial or temporal resolution. The visual analysis of this static or dynamic data is a challanging task.

Our goal here is to describe methods that visualize vascular structures. Our initial interest is how to separate this structures from background data.
