\section{Skeletonization}

Skeletonization can be seen either as integral part of surface visualization techniques or as an separate preprocessing step. Actually both is true according to the observed methods as some surface visualization techniques compute the skeleton in an internal stage of the process. Here we focus on the preprocessing step.
